The remoteApi library could not be loaded. Make sure
it is located in the same folder as "sim.py", or
appropriately adjust the file "sim.py"

"sim.py" could not be imported. This means very probably that
either "sim.py" or the remoteApi library could not be found.
Make sure both are in the same folder as this file,
or appropriately adjust the file "sim.py"
